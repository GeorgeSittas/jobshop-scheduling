# Prolog-CSP

This project contains the solutions to various search problems, including some constraint satisfaction problems,
implemented in [ECLiPSe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECLiPSe) Prolog. These problems were given as assignments
for the course Logic Programming ([YS05](http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~takis/ys05.html)), NKUA. A brief description for
each problem follows:


### Matrices

Various operations on matrices, which are represented as lists of lists. The following predicates were implemented:

- cart_prod(Sets, CP) : CP is the cartesian product of the sets (lists) contained in Sets.
- matr_transp(M, T) : T is the transpose of the matrix M.
- matr_mult(M1, M2, M) : M is equal to the result of the matrix multiplication M1 â€¢ M2.
- matr_det(M, D) : D is equal to the determinant of the square matrix M.


### Jobshop

Solves two variants of the [job-shop scheduling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shop_scheduling), viewing it as a search
problem. The first one only takes into account the jobs, tasks, machine types/counts and total deadline, while the second one adds an
extra constraint: each task can only be completed by a number of workers (staff). Some auxiliary files provided for this project are:

- jobshop_validator.pl : validates whether a schedule is valid or not (based on job overlap constraints etc).
- jobshop_data.pl : data file used to test the program.


### Vertex Cover

Solves the [vertex cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover), seen as an optimization problem. Basically, given a graph
(which can be produced by graph.pl), we want to find the smallest set of vertices in the graph that covers it. The ECLiPSe libraries
[ic](https://www.eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/ic/index.html) and [branch_and_bound](http://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/branch_and_bound/index.html)
were used to solve this problem.


### Stable Marriages

Solves the [stable marriages problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem), seen as a
[CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem). The idea is that we have N men and N women and a list of partner
preferences for each one of them (of the other sex), and we want to match them into pairs, so that no unstable pair exists. The ECLiPSe
library [fd](http://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/lib/fd/index.html) was used for this problem, in order to use variables with symbolic name
domains, instead of integer domains. Some auxiliary files provided for this project are:

- randstablefddata.c : C source file that produces random data files to test the program with.
- stablefd_data : data file used to test the program.


### Jobshop Opt

Solves the second variant of the job-shop problem, seen as an optimization problem this time. The chosen utility function is the maximum
possible deadline for which the jobs can be scheduled (that is, we're trying to schedule the jobs such that the last job is scheduled as
early as possible). Some auxiliary files provided for this project are:

- jobshop_opt_data.pl : data file used to test the program.
- rand_js_data.c : C source file that produces random data files to test the program with.
